  "primary_use_cases": [
    "User visits or remembers a place and wants to save it in a few seconds via Quick Add Flow.",
    "User opens the app to see a feed of places saved by friends.",
    "User views their own profile and saved places (experiences + bookmarks).",

      "Experience detail view.",
      "Profile with experiences and bookmarks tab (bookmarks can be placeholder).",

  "success_criteria": {
    "ux": [
      "User can add a place (Quick Add Flow) in ~15 seconds or less under normal network conditions.",
      "Navigation between tabs is obvious and requires minimal taps.",
      "Experience cards are readable and scannable on small screens.",
      "Empty states clearly guide the user to next actions (e.g., follow friends, add a place)."

    "technical": [
      "Frontend uses typed API clients and shared domain models with backend.",
      "State management is simple and predictable (React Query or equivalent).",
      "Basic accessibility is respected (focus management, touch targets, contrast).",
      "Layout works well on common mobile breakpoints and desktop within a reasonable max width."
